## j

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)

J's one of my favorite languages. The only practical use I've found for it
is essentially using it as a desk calculator. But everytime I try to write
decently-sized programs I learn a lot.

I've written a little on it too:

- Hello, J! The Fibonacci Numbers - https://thatjdanisso.cool/j-fibonacci
- Hello, J! Pascal's Triangle - https://thatjdanisso.cool/j-pascal
- Hello, J! Sorting Some Strings - https://thatjdanisso.cool/j-sorting
